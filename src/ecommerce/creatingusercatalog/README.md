# TrendyTech User Catalog System

## Introduction

TrendyTech, a trailblazer in the e-commerce industry, recognized the need for a dynamic way to keep their customers engaged with the latest product offerings. They reached out for a custom solution, and the result was the User Catalog System - a Java-based application that implements the Observer design pattern to notify users about new products.

## System Overview

The User Catalog System is a sophisticated notification mechanism that allows users to subscribe and receive updates on new product additions. It's built on a robust Observer pattern, ensuring that notifications are both efficient and user-specific.

## Key Features

- **Observer Pattern**: At the heart of the system lies the Observer pattern, enabling real-time updates and seamless communication between the catalog and its subscribers.
- **User Subscription**: Users can easily subscribe to the catalog, opting in to receive notifications about new products that match their interests.
- **Product Management**: The system provides a streamlined process for adding new products, which automatically triggers notifications to all subscribed users.
- **Flexibility**: Users have complete control over their subscription, with the option to unsubscribe at any time.

## How It Works

The application consists of several key components:

- `Observer` interface: Defines the `update` method that observers must implement.
- `User` class: Implements the `Observer` interface and handles the receipt of product notifications.
- `CatalogObservable` interface: Establishes the methods for adding and removing observers, as well as notifying them.
- `Catalog` class: Implements the `CatalogObservable` interface and manages the list of observers and product updates.
- `Main` class: Orchestrates the user interaction with the catalog, handling subscriptions, product additions, and user inputs.

```java
interface Observer {
    void update(String productName);
}
